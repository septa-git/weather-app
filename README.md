# weather-app

The "Weather App" project is a web-based weather application developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript technologies. HTML forms the foundation for the page structure, CSS is utilized for styling, and JavaScript handles the programming logic.

The application provides users with a responsive and visually appealing experience. Its responsive design ensures accessibility across a range of devices, from desktops to mobile devices.

Weather icons and interactive features are implemented using the Font Awesome icon library, which is included via an external URL. This enriches the user interface with easily recognizable icons.

The script.js file manages the logic behind fetching and displaying weather data. Weather data may be obtained through a weather API, not included in this code snippet but integrated into the actual implementation. This allows users to access accurate and up-to-date weather information.

The objective of the "Weather App" project is to offer users a simple yet effective experience for monitoring weather conditions, with an attractive design and user-friendly functionality.
